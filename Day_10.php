    <!-- PHP switch Statement -->
    <?php 
        // The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
        // The PHP switch Statement
        // Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
        // Syntax
        // switch (expression) {
        //     case label1:
        //       //code block
        //       break;
        //     case label2:
        //       //code block;
        //       break;
        //     case label3:
        //       //code block
        //       break;
        //     default:
        //       //code block
        //   }          
        // This is how it works:
        // The expression is evaluated once
        // The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
        // If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
        // The break keyword breaks out of the switch block
        // The default code block is executed if there is no match
        // 1. Example

<!-- PHP Loops -->
 <?php 
            // PHP Loops
    // Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
    // Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.
    // In PHP, we have the following loop types:
    // while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
    // do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
    // for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
    // foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array

    // PHP while Loop = it work if it get a specific condition is true
    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 5){
        echo $i;
        $i++;
    }
    echo "<br>";

    // break statement 
    $i_1 = 2;
    while ($i_1 < 6){
        if ($i_1 == 3) break;
        print $i_1;
        $i_1++;
    }
    echo "<br>";
    $i_2 = 2;
    while ($i_2 < 5){
        $i_2++;
        if ($i_2 == 2) continue;
        print $i_2;
        
    }
    echo "<br>";

    // Alternative Syntax 

    $i_3 = 0;
    while ($i_3 < 7):
        print $i_3;
        $i_3++;
    endwhile;

    echo "<br>";

    // Step 10
// If you want the while loop count to 100, but only by each 10, you can increase the counter by 10 instead 1 in each iteration:

    $j = 0;
    while ($j < 100){
        $j+=10;
        print $j ."<br>" ;
    }
